# Baldurs-Ballers-HackRice22

## Inspiration
Part of the inspiration from the project came from perceived knowledge on how we could tackle different challenges using an algorithm covered in a class we took last year. The 3 of us had a relatively diverse skill set and believed that with that we could cover basically all of the bases that would be needed.

## What it does
The project builds schedule for employees based on the work orders that have been submitted. Employees are matched up to work orders by skill set, location, and availability.

## How we built it
We the built the project using React to make the frontend and Java as the backend, connected to a SQL  Server database. Those two were connected by the Axios API which facilitated communication between them. The scheduling algorithm is based on the greedy interval scheduling algorithm.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few of challenges along the way, most of which were resolved and a few which we were unable to. For example we had issues making the API that would connect the API with the react app. In addition we also had issues with the React side of things with some of the libraries that we were familiar with not being supported by other libraries in the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to get our code functioning relatively quickly, which we're proud of. We were also able to utilize several new technologies that not all of us were familiar with, and we learned a lot.

## What we learned
We learned how to make a REST API and connect Java code to a SQL Server database. This was also our first time working together on a big coding project, so we learned how to work with each other's planning and work styles.

## What's next for Baldurs Ballers v2
The next step in this project would be to fix the POST requests so that the frontend can successfully tell the backend to update the database,
